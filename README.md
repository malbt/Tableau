## Case study :<br>
**FDI (foreign direct investment) data**<br>
Is an investment in the form of a controlling ownership in a business in any country.<br>
It’s an entity based in another country, it isn’t distinguished from a foreign portfolio investment by notion of direct control.<br>

The dataset has various different sectors and the direct investment in them over the years. If you are a company and a start-up and you want to venture into a certain economic sector you will look at the sector which is most profitable to you. The next case study is based off that, to prove most beneficial to collaborate with as a company as a venture and answer some questions as follows.


Foreign Direct Investment <br>

## Case study :<br>
**NTSB Aviation Accident Dataset**<br>
In the words of NTSB :
>Aviation Accident Database & Synopses<br>
The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters. Generally, a preliminary report is available online within a few days of an accident. Factual information is added when available, and when the investigation is completed, the preliminary report is replaced with a final description of the accident and its probable cause. Full narrative descriptions may not be available for dates before 1993, cases under revision, or where NTSB did not have primary investigative responsibility.<br>

Working progress **...**<br>
since the data is the plan is to partition 20 years data into four, and i am trying to see the accidents based on diffrent stuations and their outcomes <br>

Phase of flight like takeoff, landing, taxi, descent etc<br>
